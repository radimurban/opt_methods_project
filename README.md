# Project for _Optimization Methods for Engineers_

This repository implements generic Genetic Algorithm and applies it to 3 various problems.

## Genetic Algorithm Description

1. Create random population of $N$ individuals $p_n$ (initialization)
2. Select parents from population
3. Generate children using mutation and crossover simplicity: again $N$ individuals
4. Check stopping criteria. If not met: goto 2 .

## Problems that we apply the GA on:
### 1. Optimal allocation of resources (OAR)
Finding the optimal allocation of resources in a supply chain to minimize costs and maximize efficiency. (Zdenek)
### 2. Optimizing the design of an aircraft (ODA)
Optimizing the design of an aircraft to maximize lift. (Radim)

#### Population
Let's assume that each candidate solution (i.e., chromosome) in the population is represented by a vector $p = V, S, \alpha , e, AR$ of design variables that define a part of an aircraft wing. The three dimensions correspond to

- $V$ is the speed of the aircraft ($m/s$)  $\in \[20-100\]$
- $S$ is the wing area ($m^2$)  $\in \[60-200\]$
- $\alpha$ is the angle of attack  $\in \[0-90\]$
- $e$ is the Oswald efficiency factor  $\in \[0-1\]$
- $AR$ is the wing aspect ratio  $\in \[5-15\]$

#### Fitness function
Each chromosome is evaluated by a fitness function that computes its performanceand assigns a fitness score. In this case we want to compute the maximum lift.

**Lift ($L$):** The lift generated by the wing depends on the air density, the speed of the aircraft, and the geometry of the wing. The lift can be computed using the following formula:

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} * \rho * V^2 * S * \frac{(2 * \pi * \alpha)}{ (1 + (\pi * e * AR))}
$$

where:
- $\rho$ is the air density (kg/m^3) -> Assume constant at $1.293 kg/m^3$

#### Parent Selection
We will choose two parents. Both as chromosome maximizing the fitness function among 5 randomly selected chromosomes.
Randomness might make sense because for example of different conditions for the plane (meaning, the chromosome maximizing the fitness function might not maximize it in all conditions). 

Selecting one parent will look like this:

```java
Chromosome best = null;
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        Chromosome individual = individuals[random.nextInt(individuals.length)];
        if (best == null || individual.getFitness() > best.getFitness()) {
            best = individual;
        }
    }
return best;
```

#### Generating Children
We generate children as follows. To optimize over all possible conditions not taken into account by the fitness function we will compute the average of respective values in the chromosome and replace the worst chromosome in the population.

#### Stopping Criteria
We will pre-define the number of generations we want to optimize over and abort after achieving this number.
