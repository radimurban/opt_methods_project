# 2. Optimizing the design of an aircraft (ODA)
Optimizing the design of an aircraft to maximize lift. (Radim)

## Population
Let's assume that each candidate solution (i.e., chromosome) in the population is represented by a vector $p = V, S, \alpha , e, AR$ of design variables that define a part of an aircraft. The dimensions correspond to:

- $V$ is the speed of the aircraft ($m/s$)  $\in \[20; 350\]$
- $S$ is the wing area ($m^2$)  $\in \[60; 200\]$
- $\alpha$ is the angle of attack  $\in \[0; 1.57079633\]$
- $e$ is the Oswald efficiency factor  $\in \[0; 1\]$
- $AR$ is the wing aspect ratio  $\in \[5; 15\]$

## Fitness function
Each chromosome is evaluated by a fitness function that computes its performanceand assigns a fitness score. In this case we want to compute the maximum lift.

**Lift ($L$):** The lift generated by the plane depends on the air density, the speed of the aircraft, and the geometry of the wing. The lift can be computed using the following formula:

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} * \rho * V^2 * S * \frac{(2 * \pi * \alpha)}{ (1 + (\pi * e * AR))}
$$

where:
- $\rho$ is the air density (kg/m^3) -> Assume constant at $1.293 kg/m^3$

## Parent Selection
We will choose two parents. Both as chromosome maximizing the fitness function among 10 randomly selected chromosomes.
Randomness might make sense because for example of different conditions for the plane (meaning, the chromosome maximizing the fitness function might not maximize it in all conditions). 

Selecting one parent will look like this:

```java
Chromosome best = null;
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        Chromosome individual = individuals[random.nextInt(individuals.length)];
        if (best == null || individual.getFitness() > best.getFitness()) {
            best = individual;
        }
    }
return best;
```

## Generating Children
We generate children as follows. To optimize but also to keep randomness in the process we _randomly_ mix the genes of the two parents. 

```java
double[] childGenes = new double[genes.length];
for (int i = 0; i < childGenes.length; i++) {
    childGenes[i] = random.nextBoolean() ?  this.getGenes()[i] : other.getGenes()[i];
}
return new Chromosome(childGenes);
```
## Stopping Criteria
We will pre-define the number of generations we want to optimize over and abort after achieving this number.

## Sample Results
Following result was obtained by having `POPULATION_SIZE = 150` and stopping criteria constant `MAX_GENERATIONS = 100`.

```
Result is returning the maximized Lift $L$. At this point it would obviously easy to extract the genes which have maximized this property.
We can reason that the delievered result is somewhat reasonable by realizing that an airplane can weigh up to $600.000 kg$ corresponding rouhgly to needed lift of at least $6MN$. At generation 100, the best configuration has a lift force of roughly $45 MN$. That means there is an order of magnitude difference to the enforced minimum and in real life, ther would be many factors further limiting the lift force.
